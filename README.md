# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse
The Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse project enable users to interact with computers through hand gestures, thereby eliminating the need for direct physical contact with traditional input devices. 
By harnessing the capabilities of OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system achieves accurate and real-time hand gesture recognition. The primary focus of the project is on developing a robust hand gesture recognition system.OpenCV and MediaPipe are utilized to process hand landmarks and identify various static and dynamic gestures. This approach ensures high-performance and efficient gesture recognition across diverse hand shapes and lighting conditions. The system implements essential mouse functionalities, including cursor movement, left-click, right-click, double-click, scrolling, dragging and dropping items, and multiple item selection, thereby providing users with seamless control over their virtual mouse. Throughout testing, the Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse demonstrates promising results with high accuracy in recognizing hand gestures and delivering real-time responsiveness. This project's novel HCI approach opens up new avenues for user-computer interactions, particularly in situations where traditional input devices may not be the most practical option.
Users can control the virtual mouse's movement, execute left-clicks, right-clicks, and double-clicks, and perform more advanced tasks such as scrolling, dragging and dropping items, and making multiple item selections.
